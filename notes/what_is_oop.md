    * internal

* Encapsulation
    * facilitates code refactoring
    * encourages decoupling [^1]

* Inheritance
    * relationships: "is-a-type-of" or"has-a"
    * Multiple inheritance [^2], mixins [^3]
    * open/closed principle [^4]

* Polymorphism [^5]
    * Ad hoc polymorphism
    * Parametric polymorphism
    * Subtyping
    * Row polymorphism
    * Polytypism
